Welcome to **UniLib**, a revolutionary platform where **students from different universities and schools** can **create discussion rooms**, **share study materials**, and **collaborate across disciplines** — all structured by **University**, **Faculty**, **Course**, **Subject**, **Year**, and **Semester**.

No more losing PDFs, notes, or past papers. On UniLib, **your knowledge lives forever**.

---

## 🚀 Why UniLib?

In today's fast-paced academic world, students often struggle to:
- Reconnect with shared materials from previous semesters
- Discuss with peers outside their own institution
- Find resources by **exact academic context** (e.g. *Faculty of Science → Computer Science → 2nd Year → Semester 1*)

**UniLib changes that.** This is your permanent, organized, and collaborative **academic ecosystem**.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Create public or private discussion rooms** for any subject  
- **Upload and organize study materials** by:  
> 📍 University → Faculty → Course → Subject → Year → Semester 1/2  

- **Search & Filter** resources intuitively  
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop  
- **Secure & persistent** file storage (no expirations)  
- **Community-driven moderation & feedback system**
